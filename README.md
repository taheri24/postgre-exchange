# Convert Major Databases to PostgreSQL

## Introduction
This project aims to facilitate the conversion of major databases to PostgreSQL, leveraging the efficiency of Golang for backend processing and React for a user-friendly frontend interface. The tool is designed to simplify the migration process, ensuring data integrity and minimal downtime.

## Why Use It
- **PostgreSQL** is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system known for its robustness and advanced features.
- This tool streamlines the migration process from various database systems to PostgreSQL, making it easier for developers and database administrators.
- It ensures data integrity during the conversion and provides monitoring capabilities to track database activity in real time.

## Installing
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/convert-major-databases-to-postgresql.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
cd convert-major-databases-to-postgresql
Install dependencies:
bash
go mod tidy
